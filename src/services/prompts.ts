Summary: [Brief summary of the PAD's FCV sensitivity]

Characteristic 1: Consider How Interactions Between Climate & FCV Affect Program Delivery
Revised Guiding Question: Does the PAD recognize FCV as a key risk in both the background and key risks sections, and does it identify specific pathways through which climate impacts (e.g., floods, droughts, storms) interact with FCV dynamics (e.g., resource scarcity, governance challenges, social tensions)?
Core Issues to Consider:
At a minimum, the PAD should meaningfully mention FCV-related risks within its background and key risks sections, indicating that FCV is a potential barrier to project implementation. The document should not only acknowledge these risks but also offer some explanation—even if basic—of the causal pathways (for example, how climate-induced resource scarcity might lead to governance challenges or social tensions).
Scoring Details:
Score 0: The PAD does not provide any meaningful mention of FCV-related risks in the background or key risks sections.
Score 1: The PAD makes a minimal or vague reference to FCV-related risks but does not explain how climate impacts might trigger or worsen these dynamics.
Score 2: The PAD meaningfully mentions FCV-related risks and offers a basic explanation of potential impacts; however, the description of causal pathways is generic and lacks in-depth context.
Score 3: The PAD offers a comprehensive analysis by meaningfully mentioning FCV-related risks and clearly explaining specific causal pathways with context-specific examples (e.g., detailing how climate-induced resource scarcity leads to governance challenges or social tensions).

Probabilities: score 0 [probability], score 1 [probability], score 2 [probability], score 3 [probability]

Characteristic 2: Mitigate the Risk of Climate Actions Resulting in Maladaptation
This characteristic is divided into two sub-questions.
2A. Preventing Maladaptation in Project Interventions
Revised Guiding Question 2A: Does the PAD describe specific measures or actions that ensure project interventions do not exacerbate FCV-related vulnerabilities or create new sources of tension?
Core Issues to Consider:
At a minimum, the PAD should indicate that measures or actions exist to prevent project interventions from heightening FCV-related risks. It should demonstrate awareness that its activities might unintentionally intensify vulnerabilities. Higher scores are awarded when the PAD clearly articulates well-defined, context-specific measures or actions—detailing how the project will monitor its impacts and adjust interventions to minimize negative outcomes and respond to emerging FCV-related tensions.
Scoring Details:
Score 0: The PAD does not provide any meaningful mention of measures or actions to prevent the exacerbation of FCV-related vulnerabilities.
Score 1: The PAD makes a minimal or vague reference to the need for such measures, without describing specific actions to mitigate FCV vulnerabilities.
Score 2: The PAD meaningfully mentions that measures or actions will be taken to prevent worsening FCV-related vulnerabilities, although the description is basic and lacks detailed explanation.
Score 3: The PAD offers a comprehensive strategy by clearly describing specific, context-specific measures or actions. It explains how the project will continuously monitor its impacts and adjust interventions to prevent exacerbation of FCV-related vulnerabilities, providing thorough examples and mechanisms.
Key Sections to Review:
Key Risks and Mitigation Measures, Implementation Arrangements, Social Safeguards, and sections detailing project design or monitoring mechanisms.
Analysis: [Your analysis here]
Probabilities: score 0 [probability], score 1 [probability], score 2 [probability], score 3 [probability]

2B. Adaptive Project Design
Revised Guiding Question 2B: To what extent does the PAD incorporate adaptive mechanisms in project design that balance short-term needs with long-term resilience building in an FCV setting and account for various scenarios of FCV evolution and potential escalation?
Core Issues to Consider:
At a minimum, the PAD should acknowledge the need to balance immediate interventions with long-term resilience in FCV settings and indicate some awareness of potential shifts in the FCV context. Higher scores are given when the PAD outlines clear adaptive mechanisms—such as detailed scenario planning or specific contingency measures—that enable the project to adjust to different FCV scenarios and escalation risks.
Scoring Details:
Score 0: The PAD does not mention any adaptive mechanisms or evidence of balancing short-term needs with long-term resilience.
Score 1: The PAD makes a minimal reference to adaptive project design without specifying how it will address varied FCV scenarios or long-term resilience.
Score 2: The PAD acknowledges the need for adaptive measures and balance between short-term and long-term needs; however, the measures described are generic and lack sufficient detail or examples.
Score 3: The PAD provides a comprehensive strategy that incorporates detailed, tailored adaptive mechanisms. It clearly demonstrates how short-term interventions are balanced with long-term resilience objectives, supported by specific examples and thorough scenario-based planning.

Probabilities: score 0 [probability], score 1 [probability], score 2 [probability], score 3 [probability]

Characteristic 3: Prioritize Climate Actions That Address FCV Root Causes & Enhance Peacebuilding
Revised Guiding Question: Does the PAD include interventions that explicitly address the root causes of FCV (such as inequitable access to resources or weak governance) and seek to promote activities related to peacebuilding (directly or indirectly) where relevant?
Core Issues to Consider:
At a minimum, the PAD should identify and address the root causes of FCV by highlighting issues such as governance deficits or resource inequities. The document should at least outline these challenges in basic terms. Higher scores are given when the PAD additionally identifies opportunities to promote activities related to peacebuilding—such as fostering dialogue, trust, or social cohesion—where relevant to the context of the intervention.
Scoring Details:
Score 0: The PAD does not identify or address the root causes of FCV.
Score 1: The PAD offers a minimal or superficial mention of FCV root causes without including any activities related to peacebuilding.
Score 2: The PAD identifies the root causes of FCV (for example, governance deficits or resource inequities) and hints at the potential for related peacebuilding activities, but without describing concrete actions.
Score 3: The PAD provides a comprehensive strategy that explicitly addresses both the root causes of FCV and, where relevant, seeks to promote peacebuilding activities. It includes detailed, context-specific analysis that demonstrates an effort to incorporate opportunities for fostering dialogue, trust, or social cohesion.

Characteristic 4: Prioritize the Needs and Capacities of Vulnerable Regions and Groups
Revised Guiding Question: Does the PAD identify vulnerable populations at risk of FCV (such as women, displaced persons, and minorities) and actively propose measures to address inequalities through targeted interventions and equitable benefit sharing?
Core Issues to Consider:
At a minimum, the PAD should clearly identify vulnerable groups and meaningfully discuss their specific FCV-related needs, rather than providing only cursory mentions. Higher scores are awarded when the PAD not only identifies these groups but also outlines concrete, targeted strategies—such as social impact assessments or grievance redress mechanisms—that promote equitable benefit sharing and actively address existing inequalities.
Scoring Details:
Score 0: The PAD does not meaningfully identify vulnerable populations or discuss their FCV-related needs.
Score 1: The PAD offers only minimal or vague references to vulnerable populations without providing specific details on their needs or targeted interventions.
Score 2: The PAD clearly identifies vulnerable groups and outlines their needs; however, the measures proposed to address inequalities or ensure equitable benefit sharing are basic and lack depth.
Score 3: The PAD provides a comprehensive and in-depth strategy that not only identifies vulnerable populations and their needs but also articulates robust, targeted interventions to ensure equitable benefit sharing and effectively address systemic inequalities related to FCV.

Probabilities: score 0 [probability], score 1 [probability], score 2 [probability], score 3 [probability]

Characteristic 5: Encourage Coordination Across Development, DRM, & Peacebuilding Actors
Revised Guiding Question: Does the PAD engage with a diverse range of stakeholders (especially beyond government) and outline mechanisms to prevent mandate duplication while ensuring active coordination among humanitarian, peacebuilding, and disaster risk management actors?
Core Issues to Consider:
At a minimum, the PAD should provide meaningful evidence of stakeholder engagement—this could include references to consultations or participation in relevant networks. Higher scores are reserved for PADs that detail formal coordination mechanisms (for example, through joint working groups or integrated planning frameworks) that actively prevent mandate duplication and foster robust cross-sector collaboration.
Scoring Details:
Score 0: The PAD does not provide any meaningful evidence of stakeholder engagement.
Score 1: The PAD offers only minimal references to stakeholder engagement, with no detailed coordination mechanisms presented.
Score 2: The PAD demonstrates basic stakeholder engagement and mentions some coordination mechanisms; however, the description is generic and lacks specificity.
Score 3: The PAD provides a comprehensive and detailed account of stakeholder engagement and formal coordination mechanisms. It clearly outlines structures and processes that prevent mandate duplication and foster active, cross-sector collaboration among humanitarian, peacebuilding, and DRM actors.

Evaluation Criteria
Characteristic 1: Consider How Interactions Between Climate & FCV Affect Program Delivery

Guiding Question: Does the PAD explicitly identify risks to project implementation from FCV-related barriers (e.g., security risks, institutional weaknesses, or strained community relations)?
Core Issues to Consider: This question evaluates whether the PAD anticipates and addresses FCV-related risks that might disrupt the project. Relevant traits include identifying barriers such as insecurity, governance deficits, corruption, or social mistrust, which can impede delivery. Look for explicit acknowledgment of risks in areas like service delivery, stakeholder engagement, or operational access.
High vs. Low Scores: A high score reflects clearly identified risks, with detailed mitigation strategies such as capacity-building for weak institutions or contingency plans for conflict-prone areas. A low score reflects minimal or superficial identification of FCV risks, with no evidence of how these might impact implementation or how they would be mitigated.

Probabilities: [probabilities for each score]
Log Probabilites: [log probabilities for each score]
Score: [0-3]
Running sum: [Sum of scores for questions till now]

Guiding Question: To what extent does the PAD seek to identify the specific pathways through which climate impacts interact with FCV dynamics?
Core Issues to Consider: This question assesses whether the PAD explains how climate-related risks (e.g., floods, droughts, storms) exacerbate or intersect with drivers of fragility, conflict, and violence (FCV). Discussions should highlight how resource scarcity, governance challenges, or displacement may emerge or worsen due to climate impacts. The PAD should provide evidence-based, context-specific analysis.
High vs. Low Scores: A high score reflects a detailed and localized analysis of climate-FCV interactions, linking specific climate risks to governance failures, social inequalities, or resource disputes. A low score indicates either a lack of analysis or only generic references to climate-FCV interactions.

Characteristic 2: Mitigate the Risk of Climate Actions Resulting in Maladaptation

Guiding Question: Does the PAD incorporate specific safeguards to ensure project interventions do not exacerbate FCV-related vulnerabilities or create new sources of tension?
Core Issues to Consider: This question examines whether the project design includes safeguards to prevent unintended consequences that could increase fragility, such as competition over resources, exclusion of vulnerable groups, or reinforcing local inequalities.
High vs. Low Scores: A high score reflects a well-developed safeguards framework, including measures like conflict-sensitive programming and community engagement. A low score suggests limited or no discussion of safeguards to prevent harm.

Guiding Question: Does the PAD show evidence of explicit efforts to balance immediate needs with long-term resilience-building in a way that avoids maladaptive outcomes?
Core Issues to Consider: This question assesses whether the PAD takes a balanced approach to addressing urgent climate-related needs (e.g., disaster response, humanitarian aid) while ensuring long-term resilience (e.g., sustainable infrastructure, capacity-building). Maladaptation occurs when short-term measures (e.g., temporary flood barriers, rapid deforestation for agricultural expansion) create vulnerabilities that increase future risks.
High vs. Low Scores: A high score reflects a well-integrated approach where interventions are designed for both immediate relief and long-term sustainability, with explicit risk assessments and mitigation strategies. A low score reflects a lack of foresight, where short-term actions may unintentionally worsen vulnerabilities or fail to align with long-term development goals.

Guiding Question: Does the project actively seek to promote peacebuilding, such as fostering trust, social cohesion, or conflict resolution?
Core Issues to Consider: This question examines whether the PAD integrates peacebuilding efforts into its climate interventions. Effective projects in FCV settings should not only mitigate environmental risks but also address social and political tensions that contribute to conflict. Examples include participatory decision-making, community dispute resolution mechanisms, and ensuring marginalized groups are included in governance structures.
High vs. Low Scores: A high score reflects intentional peacebuilding elements, such as inclusive governance mechanisms, conflict-sensitive resource management, or dialogue facilitation. A low score lacks any consideration of how the project may influence or mitigate social tensions.

Guiding Question: Are mechanisms included to ensure equitable benefit-sharing and avoid reinforcing inequalities?
Core Issues to Consider: This question evaluates whether the project actively ensures that benefits (e.g., resources, infrastructure, economic opportunities) are fairly distributed across different social groups, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected settings. Without careful planning, projects can unintentionally exacerbate existing inequalities by favoring certain regions, ethnic groups, or social classes.
High vs. Low Scores: A high score reflects proactive measures such as social impact assessments, grievance mechanisms, and affirmative actions to support marginalized communities. A low score indicates a lack of safeguards, risking uneven benefits distribution and potential conflicts.

Evaluation Criteria
Characteristic 1: Consider How Interactions Between Climate & FCV Affect Program Delivery

1.	Guiding Question: Does the PAD explicitly identify risks to project implementation from FCV-related barriers (e.g., security risks, institutional weaknesses, or strained community relations)?
Core Issues to Consider: This question evaluates whether the PAD anticipates and addresses FCV-related risks that might disrupt the project. Relevant traits include identifying barriers such as insecurity, governance deficits, corruption, or social mistrust, which can impede delivery. Look for explicit acknowledgment of risks in areas like service delivery, stakeholder engagement, or operational access.
High vs. Low Scores: A high score reflects clearly identified risks, with detailed mitigation strategies such as capacity-building for weak institutions or contingency plans for conflict-prone areas. A low score reflects minimal or superficial identification of FCV risks, with no evidence of how these might impact implementation or how they would be mitigated.

Probabilities: [probabilities for each score]
Log Probabilites: [log probabilities for each score]
Score: [0-10]
Running sum: [Sum of scores for questions till now]

2.	Guiding Question: To what extent does the PAD seek to identify the specific pathways through which climate impacts interact with FCV dynamics?
Core Issues to Consider: This question assesses whether the PAD explains how climate-related risks (e.g., floods, droughts, storms) exacerbate or intersect with drivers of fragility, conflict, and violence (FCV). Discussions should highlight how resource scarcity, governance challenges, or displacement may emerge or worsen due to climate impacts. The PAD should provide evidence-based, context-specific analysis.
High vs. Low Scores: A high score reflects a detailed and localized analysis of climate-FCV interactions, linking specific climate risks to governance failures, social inequalities, or resource disputes. A low score indicates either a lack of analysis or only generic references to climate-FCV interactions.

Characteristic 2: Mitigate the Risk of Climate Actions Resulting in Maladaptation

1.	Guiding Question: Does the PAD incorporate specific safeguards to ensure project interventions do not exacerbate FCV-related vulnerabilities or create new sources of tension?
Core Issues to Consider: This question examines whether the project design includes safeguards to prevent unintended consequences that could increase fragility, such as competition over resources, exclusion of vulnerable groups, or reinforcing local inequalities.
High vs. Low Scores: A high score reflects a well-developed safeguards framework, including measures like conflict-sensitive programming and community engagement. A low score suggests limited or no discussion of safeguards to prevent harm.

Score: [0-10]
Running sum: [Sum of scores for questions till now]

3.	Guiding Question: Does the PAD show evidence of explicit efforts to balance immediate needs with long-term resilience-building in a way that avoids maladaptive outcomes?
Core Issues to Consider: This question assesses whether the PAD takes a balanced approach to addressing urgent climate-related needs (e.g., disaster response, humanitarian aid) while ensuring long-term resilience (e.g., sustainable infrastructure, capacity-building). Maladaptation occurs when short-term measures (e.g., temporary flood barriers, rapid deforestation for agricultural expansion) create vulnerabilities that increase future risks.
High vs. Low Scores: A high score reflects a well-integrated approach where interventions are designed for both immediate relief and long-term sustainability, with explicit risk assessments and mitigation strategies. A low score reflects a lack of foresight, where short-term actions may unintentionally worsen vulnerabilities or fail to align with long-term development goals.

Characteristic 3: Prioritize Climate Actions That Address FCV Root Causes & Enhance Peacebuilding

1.	Guiding Question: Does the PAD include interventions that explicitly address root causes of FCV, such as inequitable access to resources or weak governance?
Core Issues to Consider: Projects should aim to reduce fragility by tackling governance challenges, improving resource management, and strengthening institutions.
High vs. Low Scores: A high score reflects targeted interventions to address FCV root causes, while a low score suggests no consideration of these factors.

2.	Guiding Question: Does the project actively seek to promote peacebuilding, such as fostering trust, social cohesion, or conflict resolution?
Core Issues to Consider: This question examines whether the PAD integrates peacebuilding efforts into its climate interventions. Effective projects in FCV settings should not only mitigate environmental risks but also address social and political tensions that contribute to conflict. Examples include participatory decision-making, community dispute resolution mechanisms, and ensuring marginalized groups are included in governance structures.
High vs. Low Scores: A high score reflects intentional peacebuilding elements, such as inclusive governance mechanisms, conflict-sensitive resource management, or dialogue facilitation. A low score lacks any consideration of how the project may influence or mitigate social tensions.

2.	Guiding Question: Are mechanisms included to ensure equitable benefit-sharing and avoid reinforcing inequalities?
Core Issues to Consider: This question evaluates whether the project actively ensures that benefits (e.g., resources, infrastructure, economic opportunities) are fairly distributed across different social groups, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected settings. Without careful planning, projects can unintentionally exacerbate existing inequalities by favoring certain regions, ethnic groups, or social classes.
High vs. Low Scores: A high score reflects proactive measures such as social impact assessments, grievance mechanisms, and affirmative actions to support marginalized communities. A low score indicates a lack of safeguards, risking uneven benefits distribution and potential conflicts.
